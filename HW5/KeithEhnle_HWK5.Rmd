```

#1
```{r}

Sorted <- arrange(mtcars, cyl, gear)

```

#2
```{r}

Row_Names <- mutate(Sorted, model = row.names(Sorted))

```

#3
```{r}

Row_Names$model = gsub( " ", "_", Row_Names$model)  

```

#4
```{r}

mpg_high<- filter(Row_Names, mpg >= 20)

```

#5
```{r}

  select(cyl, hp, model, gear) %>%
  arrange(hp) %>%
  mutate(new_variable = cyl * gear)

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
