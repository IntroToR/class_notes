This homework should be submited as an R Markdown document saved with your name (e.g. samuel_fernandes.Rmd) and pushed to the HW5 folder on the class_notes repository on the IntroToR GitHub by next Monday. All code used to get the answers should be provided as R chunks.

Using the R example data “mtcars”, do the following (when possible, try using the options available on the tidyverse package):
1) Sort the dataset based on the variables “cyl” and “gear” (a single step, cyl is the first variable to be sorted and gear the second one).
2) Create a variable called “model” with the names of the rows of this dataset.
3) Replace the space of all the models by "_" (e.g., replace “Toyota Corona” by “Toyota_Corona”).
4) Create two datasets, one with mpg_low (by selecting cars with MPG less than 20) and mpg_high (by selecting cars with MGP greater than or equal 20)
5) Using the pipe (%>%) command do all of these steps onto the mtcars dataset: sort by “hp”, remove all columns different than “cyl”, “hp”, " model“, and”gear“, create a new variable named”new_variable" that is the multiplication of “cyl” x “gear”.
