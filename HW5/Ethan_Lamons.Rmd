# Part 1

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
data("mtcars")
arrange(mtcars, cyl, gear)
```

# Part 2

```{r}
#I didn't know what exactly you wanted from this so here is both creating a vector with the model names and creating a column named model in mtcars
model_1 <- rownames(mtcars)
model_1


mtcars <- rownames_to_column(mtcars, var = 'model')
mtcars
```

# Part 3

```{r}
#Same as the last part, first with the variable and then editing the column in the data table.
gsub(" ", "_", model_1)

mtcars$model = gsub(" ", "_", mtcars$model)
mtcars
```

# Part 4

```{r}
mpg_low <- filter(mtcars, mpg < 20)
mpg_low
mpg_high <- filter(mtcars, mpg >= 20)
mpg_high
```

# Part 5

```{r}
mtcars %>%
  arrange(hp) %>%
  select(model, cyl, hp, gear) %>%
  mutate(new_variable = cyl * gear)

```
