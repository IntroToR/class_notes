install.packages("nycflights13")
library(nycflights13)
flight_data <- flights

#1
```{r}
range(flight_data$distance)
mean(flight_data$distance)
median(flight_data$distance)
```

#2
```{r}
data("airlines")
combine_airlines_flights <- merge(flights, airlines)
write.table(combine_airlines_flights, file = "Airline & Flight combo.csv")
```

#3
```{r}
American_airlines <- combine_airlines_flights %>%
  filter(carrier == "AA") %>%
  arrange(arr_delay) %>%
write.table("American_flights.csv")
```

#4
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(combine_airlines_flights, aes(x=carrier, y=dep_delay))+ 
  geom_boxplot()
```

#5
```{r}
ggplot(combine_airlines_flights, aes(month, arr_delay)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_continuous(n.breaks = 12)
```
Highest indiviudal value is in month 1 for arr_delay
```{r}
mean_arr_delay <- combine_airlines_flights %>%
  group_by(month) %>%
  summarise(average_delay = mean(Average_delay, na.rm = TRUE))
```
I cannot get this summarize line to run correctly but at one point I saw month 7 was the highest before messing something up.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
