```{r}
library(nycflights13)
library(tidyverse)
data("flights")
```


# Part 1

```{r}
distance_mean <- mean(flights$distance, na.rm = TRUE)
distance_mean
distance_range <- range(flights$distance, na.rm = TRUE)
distance_range
distance_median <- median(flights$distance, na.rm = TRUE)
distance_median
```

# Part 2

```{r}
airlines_and_flights <- full_join(airlines, flights)
airlines_and_flights
```

# Part 3

```{r}
AA_only <- airlines_and_flights %>%
  filter(carrier == "AA") %>%
  arrange(arr_delay) %>%
  write.table("AA_only.txt")
```

# Part 4

```{r}
ggplot(airlines_and_flights) +
  aes(x = carrier, y = dep_delay, colour = carrier) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

# Part 5

```{r}
ggplot(airlines_and_flights) +
  aes(x = month, y = arr_delay) +
  geom_col(width = 0.75) +
  scale_x_continuous(n.break = 12)
```
From the above graph, you can see that July had the highest arr_delay.
