```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Install packages:
```{r}
install.packages("nycflights13")
install.packages("tidyverse")
library(nycflights13)
library(tidyverse)
data("flights")

```


Question 1:
```{r}
flights_mean <- mean(flights$distance)
flights_range <- range(flights$distance)
flights_median <- median(flights$distance)

```


Question 2:
```{r}
data("airlines")
merged_data <- merge(flights, airlines)
write.table(merged_data, file="airlines_flights.txt")

```


Question 3:
```{r}
merged_data %>% 
  filter(carrier == "AA") %>% 
  arrange(arr_delay) %>% 
  write.table("american_airlines.txt")
```


Question 4:
```{r}
dep_delay_plot <- ggplot(flights, aes(x=carrier, y=dep_delay))+
  geom_boxplot(na.rm =T)+
  ggtitle("Departure Delays by Carrier")+
  theme(plot.title=element_text(hjust = 0.5))+
  #above line is to center the title
  geom_point(color="red")
  labs(x = "Carrier", y = "Departure Delay Time (mins)")

dep_delay_plot
```


Question 5:
```{r}
ggplot(flights, aes(x = month, y = arr_delay))+ 
  geom_point(color = 'red', na.rm = T)+ 
  ggtitle('Flight Arrival Delay')+ 
  theme(plot.title=element_text(hjust = 0.5))+
  labs(x = 'Month', y = 'Arrival Delays (mins)')

# The graph shows January is the month with the longest delay
```


## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
